Copyright 2023 Moment Factory Studios Inc.

An Omniverse extension for converting [MVR (My Virtual Rig)](https://github.com/mvrdevelopment/spec/blob/main/mvr-spec.md) files to USD, by creating a USD file that references imported GDTF files (using the Moment Factory mf.ov.gdtf extension).

MVR (My Virtual Rig) is a scene format that can describe an complete rig of lights, using GDTF assets at its core while adding capabilities to define groups, layers, DMX address and more to allow lighting designer to build virtual replicas of their lighting rigs and enforce a single file format from show design to previz to operation.
